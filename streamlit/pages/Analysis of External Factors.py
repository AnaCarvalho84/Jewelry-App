Based on the calculated correlations, it appears that meteorological factors do not have a strong linear relationship with sales. From what we observed in the plots, these factors do not seem to have a direct linear impact on sales in this dataset.

        From a preliminary observation, it seems there might be a slight increase in sales towards the end of the month for Store 1. However, the pattern is not very pronounced for Store 2. After conducting a statistical analysis to compare the average sales between the days of the payment period and the other days, there is a significant difference in average sales between the payday period and other days of the month for Store 1. This suggests that the payday period might have an influence on sales for Store 1. In contrast, this pattern doesn't occur for Store 2, and the payday period doesn't seem to influence its sales.
